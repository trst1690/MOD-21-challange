# MOD-21-challange
The purpose of this analysis we created a deep learning nueral network to see the success of the donations by Alphabet Soup. In doing so we made the IS-Successful column the target dropped EIN and Name columns and used the rest as the features. My neural network started with two layers but after the optimization I landed 3 hidden layers as it raised the accuracy of the models predictions. I used three diffrent activation functions inluding adam which I used in the optimization. I also used Sigmund and ReLU but didnt recive the the accuracy score I wanted.
